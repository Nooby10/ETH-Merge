I will be doing media analytics for the Web 3.0 On-Chain Ethereum Merge event. I will use visual representation to tell and visualize the uncovered insights,  and ascertaining if the event had possible impacts on Ether price.
Furthermore, I will perform Natural Language Processing Exploratory Data Analysis tasks derive better insights and analyze the sentiment of Twitter users on the event.

Lastly, I will be using Power BI to build an insightful dashboard to present the key metrics.
